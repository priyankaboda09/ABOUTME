 Hi, Iâ€™m Priyanka 

Iâ€™m a technology student with a foundation in **Cybersecurity and Information Security**, now expanding into **Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics**.  

I started out learning Blue Team operations, SOC workflows, and threat detection, where I gained hands-on experience with tools like Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite, and Metasploit. That phase helped me develop an attackerâ€“defender mindset, sharpening my problem-solving and analytical skills.  

Over time, my curiosity pulled me towards cloud computing, AI, and data analytics. Through Google Cloud projects and labs, I explored BigQuery ML, AutoML, Vision API, and Looker Studio â€” and discovered how data and AI can turn raw information into meaningful insights.  

These days, Iâ€™m building my skills in Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, and visualization tools like Power BI and Looker Studio, aiming to connect the worlds of **cybersecurity, AI, and analytics** together.  

My main areas of interest include:  
- Threat detection and log analysis (SIEM basics, SOC workflows)  
- Python for scripting and data analysis  
- SQL and BigQuery for querying and insights  
- Visualization with Looker Studio, Tableau, and Power BI  
- Cloud AI tools such as AutoML, Vision API, and Natural Language API  
- Fundamentals of web exploitation and security testing  

I see myself as someone who brings a **multi-domain perspective** â€” combining the sharpness of cybersecurity, the curiosity of AI, and the structure of analytics. Whether itâ€™s identifying vulnerabilities, analyzing datasets, or building dashboards, I enjoy learning, experimenting, and growing with every challenge.  

Iâ€™m currently exploring opportunities in **data analytics, AI/ML projects, and cybersecurity roles** where I can apply this blended skill set to real-world problems.  

If youâ€™re working in these spaces, Iâ€™d love to connect, share ideas, and learn along the way ðŸš€
